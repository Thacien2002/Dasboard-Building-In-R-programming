### R Programming for Statisticians
####INTRODUCTION TO R Programming Language
 R is a free programming language used for working with numbers and data.
It was created by two people, Ihaka and Gentleman. R is very good at doing math, statistics, and analyzing data.
Many people around the world use R and have created extra tools (called packages) to help with things like drawing graphs, building models, and machine learning.
R can work with different types of data and lets you write simple code to explore and change your data. It can also work together with other programming languages.
R is used by students, researchers, and companies to better understand and learn from data. You can find many free R tools online in a big collection called CRAN.
So if you want to work with data, R is a great place to start!

#### Getting started with R
Getting started with R
R is a programming language and environment speci cally designed for statistical computing and
graphics. Start with installing R and RStudio (an integrated development environment for R). Learn
basic R syntax, data types, and basic operations.
Download R:
Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/. Click on the
"Download R for [Your Operating System]" link.
RStudio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Visit the RStudio download
page: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Download the appropriate installer for
your operating system.
 

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
